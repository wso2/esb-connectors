            <description>Returns the top 10 trending topics for a specific WOEID, if trending information is available
                for it. The response is an array of “trend” objects that encode the name of the trending topic, the
                query parameter that can be used to search for the topic on Twitter Search, and the Twitter Search URL.
                This information is cached for 5 minutes. Requesting more frequently than that will not return any more
                data, and will count against your rate limit usage.
