Product: Integration tests for WSO2 ESB reddit connector
Pre-requisites:
- Maven 3.x
- Java 1.6 or above

Tested Platform:
- Ubuntu 14.04
- WSO2 ESB 4.9.0-BETA
- Java 1.7

STEPS:
1. Download ESB 4.9.0-BETA by navigating the following the URL: http://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/people/malaka/ESB/beta/.

2. Extract the certificate from browser by navigating to "https://www.reddit.com/" and place the certificate file in following locations.

   	i)  "<REDDIT_CONNECTOR_HOME>/reddit/org wso2.carbon.connector/src/test/resources/keystores/products"

   		Navigate to the above location from command prompt and execute 'keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore
   		wso2carbon.jks -alias "reddit"' in command line to import reddit certificate in to keystore. Give "wso2carbon" as password.
   		NOTE : CERT_FILE_NAME is the file name which was extracted from reddit with  the extension(Eg:reddit.crt),
   		change it accordingly. Remove the copied certificate.

   	ii) "<ESB_HOME>/repository/resources/security"

   		Navigate to the above location from command prompt and execute 'keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore
   		client-truststore.jks -alias "reddit"' in command line to import reddit certificate in to keystore. Give "wso2carbon" as password.
   		NOTE : CERT_FILE_NAME is the file name which was extracted from reddit with  the extension, change it accordingly.
   		Remove the copied certificate.


3.  ESB should be configured as below.
   	 Please make sure that the below mentioned Axis configurations are enabled (\repository\conf\axis2\axis2.xml).

	      <messageFormatter contentType="text/html"
							class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.ExpandingMessageFormatter"/>
	      <messageBuilder contentType="text/html"
							class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.BinaryRelayBuilder"/>
          <messageFormatter contentType="text/plain"
                            class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.ExpandingMessageFormatter"/>
          <messageBuilder contentType="text/plain"
                            class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.BinaryRelayBuilder"/>

4. Compress modified ESB as wso2esb-4.9.0-BETA.zip and copy that zip file in to location "{ESB_Connector_Home}/repository/".

5. Make sure that reddit is specified as a module in ESB_Connector_Parent pom.
     <module>reddit/reddit-connector/reddit-connector-1.0.0/org.wso2.carbon.connector</module>

6. Create a reddit account and create a secret app.
   	i) 	  Using the URL "https://www.reddit.com" create a reddit  account.
   	ii)   Using the URL "https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/" create a secret app and obtain clientId and clientSecret
   	iii)  Using the URL "https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/OAuth2" obtain the authorization code, using the authorization
   	      code retrieve the access token(code flow) and then get the refresh token (using "HTTP Basic Auth" to get access
   	      token and refresh token).
   	iv)   Using the refresh token (Bearer) in Authorization header(Eg:Bearer42591910-i3N4nJ0H3D40wR3JIgglwjY0V-E) to access
   	      the operations in reddit rest api.
   Note : When you try to get the code for the created secret app please use scope as following
   		  "scope=identity,edit,flair,history,mysubreddits,privatemessages,read,report,save,submit,subscribe,vote,wikiedit,wikiread"
   		  because, then only you can get that created app as authorized applications with that defined scope.
   Note : When try to do the manual testing, Consider the endpoint "http://www.reddit.com/" to the public methods(methods without authorization)
   		  When try to do the manual testing, Consider the endpoint "https://oauth.reddit.com/" to the Oauth scope methods such as Read,
   		  Identity,Submit,PrivateMessages,Subreddit,History and etc.
