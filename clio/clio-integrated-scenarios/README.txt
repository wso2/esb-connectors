					(b) For each contact created in Clio in (a), a Tag is created in SimpleNote API.
					(c) For each contact created in Clio in (a), a note will be created under the respective Tag in SimpleNote.
						Name of the Tag would be in the format 'Active note for <first-name> <last-name>...'

		- Special Notes: (a) If the user decides to fetch contacts from ZohoCrm then initially there should be few records in the user's ZohoCrm account.
							 This is not required if the user directly gives the contact's details in the request.
						 (b) A custom field named 'Clio Contact ID' (single line text) should be created in ZohoCRM API for contacts.
						 (c) A custom field named 'Current SimpleNote Key' (single line text) should be created in Clio for contacts as a prerequisite.
		
	[ii] Case-002
		- Purpose:	(a) Retrieve the contents of selected notes in SimpleNote and create them as matters in Clio under the contact identified by the name of the tag to which the note belongs.
					(b) Add selected notes to a new Tag called 'Selected-Notes'
					(c) For each given contact, a note will be created under the respective Tag in SimpleNote. That note would then be the active note for the contact and will have the default content 'Active note for <first-name> <last-name>...'

											{"clioContactID":"889056955", "createMatter":true}
		
		- Special Notes: (a) A tag has to be created under the name 'Selected-Notes' in SimpleNote API as a prerequisite.
