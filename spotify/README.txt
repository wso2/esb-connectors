		Type this command on terminal.
        keytool -importcert -file <CERTIFICATE_FILE_NAME WITH EXTENSION> -keystore client-truststore.jks -alias "<CERTIFICATE_NAME>"
        and place the certificate file in following location also.
		"{SPOTIFY_CONNECTOR_HOME}/src/test/resources/keystores/products/"

2. Copy spotify connector zip file (spotify.zip) to the location "spotify/repository/"

        </packages>
    </test> 

4. Copy proxy files to following location "spotify/src/test/resources/artifacts/ESB/config/proxies/spotify/"

5. Copy request files to following "spotify/src/test/resources/artifacts/ESB/config/restRequests/spotify/"

   	- grant_type: to get the access token with refresh token.
	- refresh_token: refresh token is to get the access token.
	
		
7. Following data set can be used for the first testsuite run.

	- requestDirectoryRelativePath=/../src/test/resources/artifacts/ESB/config/restRequests/spotify/
	- client_id=f043fec58a584539ba94c0c588136712
	- client_secret=b421eecdfe184be29b1d297505befcac
	- grant_type=refresh_token
	- refresh_token=AQCQPj6__vnciBWMpS1lJ_V_oefCZUy2V7z_Ha7WBoZZTKRsVPgDTtecOMN5rxXs9mvtencluvX3m_RNCsTqTTJtwZCmcrte_1Ar_SzXDug-AtdbSiZXMObPa8Kw0-8tE8c
